# Linux Configuration Files

Inside the `linux` directory, you'll find my configuration files for various Linux tools and utilities. As I continue to refine my Linux setup and feel like sharing, I'll be adding more configurations to this directory.

## Files:

- **tmux**: Contains configurations for the `tmux` terminal multiplexer. Check out [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for more details.
- ... 

## Installation:

1. Clone the `my_configs` repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Secreez/my_configs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd my_configs/linux
   ```

3. Copy the desired configuration files or directories to their respective locations in your home directory or system.

## Contributing:

I'm always open to suggestions and improvements! If you have any configurations that you believe would be a great addition or any refinements to the existing ones, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
